From Zero to Hero: Advocating for Beginner-friendly Programming Resources" is an advocacy aimed at introducing the basics of computer programming to pre-computer studies students in Ateneo de Davao Senior High School who are aspiring to be an IT, IS, CS, or DS student in Ateneo de Davao University. The project aims to introduce the basic variables and if-else statements in programming, introduce the different common programming languages that are taught in college, and make the students familiarize themselves with these through a little activity after every lesson. The project's objective is to prepare students for their incoming first year of college with these learnings to not be intimidated in programming and be confident in solving problems through coding. The project aims to reach at least 50 pre-computer studies students in Ateneo de Davao Senior High School, and the students will evaluate if they learned something from the learning materials and if it is easy for them to understand. The project will be implemented through online resources and will be led by a group of senior students in various computer-related degrees.
